      Week 2: Ring of Fire
    </h2>
    <h3>The Concept</h3>
    <p>
      So for a long time now my friends and I have been playing a drinking game called “Ring of Fire” and it has quickly become one of my favourites due to how unpredictable yet simple the game is. It never fails to have you laughing by the end.
      Here is a quick explanation of the game:
      <ul>
        <li>The game can be played with any number of players but is best with between 5-10 players</li>
        <li>There are very little props needed to play this game. A large container for liquid such as a pint glass/bowl/pan, a lot of alcohol and until now deck of cards</li>
        <li>The cards are placed in a ring around the container (pictured bellow)</li>
        <li>Players take it in turns to draw cards from this ring and must carry out the corresponding rule of each card (normally leading to the consumption of alcohol)</li>
      </ul>
      For more information about the actual game or a full list of rules <a href="http://www.ringoffirerules.com/"> try this site.</a>

      <h3>The Brief</h3>
      What is that I hear you say? You should build it as an app chris? That I shall do. <br>
      As I said before, one thing that I love the most about this game is how simple it is, I thought it would be a nice little app to create in one sprint, just for the challenge. 
      <br>
      Here are the basic requirements for the game:
      <ul>
        <li>The app must usable on a range of devices and in any browser</li>
        <li>The app must have a simple user interface (it will need to be simple enough to be used by drunks)</li>
        <li>The app must explain all rules related to the game to help out first time players and anyone who is forgetful</li>
        <li>Must look pretty</li>
      </ul>
      Lets see how this goes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>Inital Planning</h3>
      I had a rough idea of how the app was going to look, I tried to keep as little screens as possible and in the end narrowed it down to just the 4: menu, play screen, rules and info. <br>
      So as with every project I started out with a simple sketch of the interface:
