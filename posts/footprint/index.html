        Ship Sunday is a project by <a href="http://chrisvasey.com">Chris Vasey</a> created to force himself to push more of his work out into the world (otherwise known as shipping).<br>
        The goal is to create a new entry every week, preferably on a sunday. To see the rest of his projects <a href="index.html">click here</a>

      Week 2: Prototyping with Pixate and a little information about Footprint
    </h2>
    <h3>The Concept</h3>
    <p>
      Here I shall be prototyping with a tool I have been waiting to use for a while called <a href="http://www.pixate.com/">Pixate</a>. <br>
      The tool is currently in a closed beta stage, though I have been lucky enough be invited to use the service early!
      <br><br>
      This week I have started work on an idea I have had for a while. <br>
      In this modern world it is common for people to make multiple transactions a day using different mediums; be it cash, debit card, store card or coupon. No matter what method is used to make this payment any good shop/merchants tilling system will then generate a payment receipt. <br><br>
      This process is great as proof of purchase and proves that you now own whatever it is that you paid money for and gives in depth details as to how the transaction too place including such specifics as the time the transaction took place and the employee who served you. <br>
      But then what? What do you do with this information?
      <br><br>
      It is forgotten, thrown away or lost. <br>
      In some cases it is saved, maybe for a expenses claim or to have the option of returning said product but then the customer is carrying around a wad of paper, this paper is printed using a thermal printer and is susceptible to fading or becoming eligible after only a slight rise in temperature (such as being carried around in a pocket for a few hours).
      <br>
      Wouldnâ€™t it be easier if this information was just sent to us the same way that they are when making a purchase online? The receipt is archive able, search able and safe. better still by storing the receipt with a digital method, it allows the information to be processed and showed in a more useful way such as displaying your recent spend in a graph or allowing you to filter payments by date.
      <br><br>
     I have a few ideas as to how this could work, I shall go into this at a later date, though this week I am going to build a prototype for an APP that records these transactions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>Basic Goals</h3>
      First I have identified some of the goals that the app must fulfill, this will make it easier while planning out the app. <br>
      These include:
      <ul>
        <li>Easy to use interface</li>
        <li>The ability to manually input recept infomation</li>
        <li>The abillity to review and filter past infomation that has been inputted</li>
        <li>Include instruction as to how the app works</li>
        <li>Make it look pretty</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>Step 1: Creating the apps assets</h3>
      The first step in creating the app prototype is to create some basic assets. These include items such as the logo, content text and buttons. <br>
      I already have a rough idea of what needs to be included int he app
