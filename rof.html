      Week 2: Ring of Fire
    </h2>
    <h3>The Concept</h3>
    <p>
      So one of my fav drinking games to play has to be a game called "Ring of Fire" and it has to be one of the most popular games played by my friends and I.
      <br><br>
      The game concept is pretty simple. A deck of cards are placed round a cup,
      Players must then take it in turns to draw a card from the circle, each card has diffrent rules attatched, these rules are normally a drinking related challange (One of the parts of the spec was to include a rules list in the APP as sometimes the rules can be hard to remember) 
      <br>
      A few times over the last few months I have said I could easily build this game out as an phone app meaning that we no longer need to seek out a pack of cards everytime we play.
