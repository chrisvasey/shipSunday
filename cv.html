      Week 1: Online CV Builder
    </h2>
    <h3>The Concept</h3>
    <p>
      So one thing that I seem to be hearing quite a lot recently is about how most peopleâ€™s CVs either don't do them justice or are substandard with a lot of missing information (though this may be due to the strange amount of recruiters I have ended up following on Twitter).
      <br><br>
      I remember when I first put my CV together when I was looking for my first job, it was hard. What do you even put into a CV? Do I just write about what I have done, what I want to do? And what do I need to include that employers need to see such as qualifications and past experience.
      <br>
      <br>
      I was lucky enough to have an employer and recruiter to help me through this but when looking for recourses online I found an overload of useless information and conflicting opinions on what is needed and I hadn't even started writing yet.
      <br><br>
      It can be hard.
      <br><br>
      For this reason I have started a little project to make the process easier. A small online web tool that helps you get started. No more staring at an intimidating blank word document, just type in the information that is needed into the web form, click "build" and watch as it magically created a nicely formatted curriculum vitae!
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>Basic Goals</h3>
      The basic goals of the project:
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Create a platform in which to present and display work
        </li>
        <li>
          It must be able to show past work in a way that is easy to find and view
        </li>
        <li>
          Must be useable on a range of devices including mobile devices
        </li>
        <li>
          It must also look kind of pretty for vanitys sake
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>The Design Process</h3>
      In order to reach the desired goals it was a quick decision to create the site in a "blog" format, though the word is used loosely! <br>
      I roughly sketched up how I wanted the sites home and blog page to look onto my laptop. These sketches gave me a rough idea of how to lay the site out once I moved into code and also made it much less intimidating the staring a blank HTML document.

      <br><br>
      <img class="img-responsive" src="images/week1/sketch.png" alt="Inital Sketch of website">
      <br>
      As you can see I am great at drawing.
      <br><br>
      Next I got into code as early as possible, the site was so simple that prototyping would have been a waste of time and with frontend frameworks being as great as they are nowadays I tend to prototype in good old HTML and CSS anyway.  
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>Technical Stuff</h3>
      To start the development of the site I chose to go with a development stack that I was familiar, this did not include a CRM system as I can simply write the text straight into my code editor and it just seemed like a waste of time, this may be something to include later if I continue to write posts. <br>
      The frameworks I chose to create the site are as follows: <br>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap:</a> CSS and Responsive Grid System
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS.js:</a> CSS Pre-processor 
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery:</a> Javascript Framework
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts">Google Fonts:</a> Font API
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome:</a> Icon CDN
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      The website is hosted on a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> droplet that I use for all my projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>Creating the Site</h3>
      Creating the site was pretty straight forward after importing all of the frameworks that I needed. <br>
      After applying some simple style to make the site look pretty I set to work at writing this post. <br>
      As the content for the site needs to be added weekly I didn't actually have a massive amount to add. <br>
      <br>
      For those who are interested in this process, the code is publicly available on github <a href="https://github.com/chrisvasey/shipSunday">here</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>A Short Conclusion</h3>
      So here it is. You are currently viewing the finished product. <br>
      Hopefully I have helped anyone interested in the web design process have a rough idea of how it works thought his may not have been an amazing example. <br>
      This post was more useful for me as it enabled me to clarify why I am doing this and once this is finished this means I have definitely started.
      <br><br>
